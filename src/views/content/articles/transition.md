Starting IAP 2019, we decided to transition our name from the official course number (6.148, now listed as 6.9620) to web.lab. The course number, while effective within MIT, was pretty meaningless to the outside world. We also wanted a name which conveyed what our class truly is: a fun, creative, technical lab where you get to iterate and build an awesome product with your peers. As such, we rebranded ourselves as web.lab.
